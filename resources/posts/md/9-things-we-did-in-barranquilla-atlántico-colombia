#9 Things We Did in Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia
During our two night/three day stay in Barranquilla, we managed to pack in quite a number of activities. Where we tired by the end of day three? Yes. Was it worth it? Definitely. Below you’ll find a list of 9 things we did or saw in Barranquilla, ranked in order from least to most favorite, including cost and helpful tips for each. Please note: This list only includes the attractions we were able to cover during our stay, so feel free to do your own research to discover what we might have missed!

##9. Catedral Metropolitana María Reina de Barranquilla and Plaza de la Paz
![A view of the Catedral Metropolitana María Reina.](/img/whatwedidbarranquilla_9_low.jpg)

**Location:** Cra. 45 ##53-140, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia (Catedral)

Located Northwest of the old city center, the Catedral Metropolitana María Reina is an impressive feat of modern architecture. Beneath angular stained-glass windows, and amid abstract depictions of flora and fauna, you’ll find the most unusual crucifix. It’s definitely worth a visit if you like looking at unique places of worship. We were slightly less impressed, however, by the Plaza de la Paz and opted for a quick visit before continuing on with the rest of our day.

**Cost:** Free!

**Tip:** Check to see if Plaza de la Paz is hosting events. This is a great way to observe local Barranquillera culture.

##8. Paseo Bolívar
**Location:** Cra. 44 #34, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia (Park)

The Paseo Bolívar is the main avenue that runs through the old city center of Barranquilla. If you want to people-watch, this is the place to go. We recommend starting at the statue of the big man himself (Simon Bolívar) and work your way past shops and vendors until the heat gets the best of you. Then, head somewhere with air conditioning.

**Cost:** Free!

**Tip:** Make this trip in the morning when the sun isn’t too high and the streets aren’t too congested.

##7. The Dock of Puerto Colombia

**Location:** Playas de Puerto Colombia, Carrera 4 #1, Puerto Colombia, Atlántico, Colombia

Puerto Colombia, a small town just outside of Barranquilla, is home to an interesting piece of Barranquillera history. The dock, which was once considered the most important maritime port in Colombia, is now slowly sinking into the Caribbean Sea. Despite its disrepair, the dock still exists as a popular spot for fishermen, local teenagers, and tourists to get a good look at the water. Sure, you have to pass through a gaping hole in a chain-link fence with a posted “Do Not Enter” sign, but feeling like a rebel is all part of the experience.

**Cost:** Free (not including transportation from Barranquilla)

**Tip:** You can take the C11 bus to the beach in Puerto Colombia. Ask your hotel/hostel for the closest bus stop.

##6. Iglesia de San Nicolás
![Looking up to the Iglesia de San Nicolás.](/img/whatwedidbarranquilla_6_low.jpg)

**Location:** Cra. 42a #80-2, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia

The Iglesia de San Nicolás is a beautifully restored neo-gothic church in the old city center of Barranquilla. It’s a quick but worthy visit, especially because there always seems to be a cool breeze running along the length of the building, offering a brief respite from the heat.

**Cost:** Free!

**Tip:** While you’re there, walk around the Plaza de San Nicolás. Observe Barranquilla city life to the soundtrack of vallenato floating out from local cafés.

##5. Museo Romántico

**Location:** Cra. 54 #59-199, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia

Visiting the Museo Romántico is less like visiting a museum and more like visiting the home of a history-obsessed hoarder—and we say that in the most endearing way possible. Instead of carefully labeled artifacts behind glass cases, the Museo Romántico is a house decorated with the most impressive treasures of the Caribbean Coast. As you roam from room to room, you’ll encounter letters written by Simon Bolívar and a typewriter used by Gabriel García Márquez, among many other pieces of Barranquillera and Colombian history.

**Cost:** 10,000 COP per person (entry fee for adults)

**Tip:** If you haven’t yet attended Barranquilla’s Carnaval, be sure to pay extra attention to the characters in the Carnaval room. The posters and costumes offer tourists a crash course on Carnaval traditions. Also, see if you can find the photo of a very young Shakira—you won’t be disappointed.

##4. Bocas de Ceniza

**Location:** Destapada Bocas De Ceniza, Barranquilla, Magdalena

Bocas de Ceniza is a strip of land that extends to the point where the Magdalena River meets the Caribbean Sea. With rushing fresh water on one side, waves of salt water on the other, and plenty of breezes all around, this attraction is as peaceful as it is unique. For Bocas de Ceniza, you can choose to visit the very tip, or enjoy the scenery at a more relaxed pace. Choose the option that works best for your budget and time restraints.

**Option 1:** The journey to the end of Bocas de Ceniza requires three forms of transportation. First, you have to take a taxi or bus to the “train station,” which looks like a small line of stripped railroad cars. The train will take you until the tracks end. The rest of the journey must be made by foot and within an hour, before the train heads back to the station. The train ride costs 15,000 COP per person and the entire trip will be at least 3 hours, so plan accordingly.

**Option 2:** We enjoyed Bocas de Ceniza at a more leisurely pace and without using the train. Instead, we asked our cab driver to take us as far as he was comfortable, which ended up being further than the train station. Then we walked along the tracks until we felt like turning back. Although we didn’t make it to the end, we still enjoyed the scenery while avoiding the cost of the train and the 3+ hour round-trip commute.

**Cost:** 15,000 COP per person (if you decide to take the train, not including transportation to the train station)

**Tip:** Whether you decide on Option 1 or Option 2, wear comfortable hiking shoes, such as sneakers or boots. The path is bumpy. And be careful to protect yourself from the sun.

##3. Castillo de Salgar
![Bluff, beach, and sea outside the Castillo de Salgar.](/img/whatwedidbarranquilla_3_low.jpg)

**Location:** At the end of Cra. 36b, Salgar, Atlántico, Colombia

This castle was built by the Spanish during the colonization of Colombia’s Caribbean coast. Even more impressive than the bright yellow castle-turned-restaurant is the land on which it sits: slopes of grassy hills that end in a bluff overlooking the sea. This is the perfect place to take some selfies.

**Cost:** Recommended 2,000 COP donation

**Tip:** For the best experience, explore the area around the castle and look for the best place to take pictures of the water.

##2. Museo del Caribe

**Location:** Cl. 36 #46 - 66, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia

As far as museums go, this is one of Barranquilla’s best. The Museo del Caribe has five permanent expositions—Nature, People, Words, Action, and Expression—each portraying a different aspect of Colombian Caribbean culture through the use of audio-visual and interactive exhibits. A word to non-Spanish speakers: You will not find translations for any of the displays. That being said, the exhibits make use of images, video, music, and sensory activities that still make the museum a worthy visit for those who need to work on their español.

**Cost:** 14,000 COP per person (entry fee for adults)

**Tip:** The earlier you get to the museum, the more likely you are to beat the crowds. Also, be sure to check out the Parque Cultural del Caribe that surrounds the museum.

##1. Convention Center in Puerta de Oro

**Location:** Cl. 79c #82-173 a 82-81, Barranquilla, Atlántico, Colombia

The Convention Center in Puerta de Oro is brand new and beautiful. We were lucky to be in town when the center was hosting Sabor Barranquilla, a gastronomic festival with cooking demonstrations, free samples, food galore, and a live demonstration of the dances and music encountered during Barranquilla’s Carnaval. Let’s just say our time spent at the event was the highlight of our trip in this charming coastal city.

**Cost:** Cost of events vary

**Tip:** DO NOT MISS the pier located behind the Convention Center. Visit in the afternoon to catch the sunset over the Magdalena River.
