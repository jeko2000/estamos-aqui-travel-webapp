#8 Things We Did in Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia
We stayed in Cartagena for four nights/five days, which gave us enough time to take a break after our marathon trip through Barranquilla. Below you’ll find a list of 8 things we did or saw in Cartagena, ranked in order from least to most favorite, including cost and helpful tips for each. Please note: This list only includes the attractions we were able to cover during our stay, so feel free to do your own research to discover what we might have missed!

##8. Plaza Santo Domingo

The most attractive feature of this plaza is the Iglesia de Santo Domingo. With its rich, golden color and large, wooden door, this church makes for the perfect backdrop to an evening spent sipping coffee at one of the many cafés in the perimeter. Here you can sit back, relax, and let the cooler night breezes take you away.

**Location:** Cl. 35, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

**Cost:** Free!

**Tip:** While enjoyable in the evening, you'll likely want to visit the plaza first thing in the morning in order to get an undisturbed shot of the Iglesia de Santo Domingo.

##7. Catedral de Santa Catalina de Alejandría
**Location:** Calle de los Santos de Piedra, Cra. 4, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

The Catedral de Santa Catalina is not only pretty to look at, but it is also a great place to find souvenirs. Walk around the cathedral to find wayuu bags, local artwork, and lots of tasty treats for purchase.

**Cost:** Free, unless you buy souvenirs!

**Tip:** Check in at different times of the day to meet different vendors.

##6. Getsemaní Nightlife
**Location:** Barrio Getsemaní, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

The neighborhood of Getsemaní has grown to become a hub for backpackers in Cartagena. As such, this little area packs in a surprising number of restaurants and bars for night owls, both locals and foreigners alike. Take your time reading menus and listening to the music before deciding on a place that suits your style. 
**Cost:** Free to visit, but not to eat and drink.

**Tip:** Make sure to explore the streets that extend outward from the Plaza de la Santísima Trinidad. Getsemaní boasts some impressive street art.

##5. Portal de los Dulces and Torre del Reloj

Just as the name suggests, the Portal de los Dulces is filled with sweets. As you walk under the colonial archways, you’ll encounter cheap, authentic, and homemade candies local to Colombia’s Caribbean coast. Once you get your fill of sugar, head across the Plaza de los Coches to the Torre del Reloj, pass through its mighty entrance, and relish the sensation of being free from the walled city. 

**Location:** Cra. 5 #33-15, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

**Cost:** Free!

**Tip:** While in the Plaza de los Coches, you’ll encounter some pretty adamant vendors trying to sell you a hat or a boat ride. A simple smile and a, “No, gracias,” will get you out of buying something you really don’t need.

##4. Eating Fish at Espíritu Santo
**Location:** Cl. 35 #6-69, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

This restaurant is famous, and for good reason. Not only is it spacious and reminiscent of an old Spanish colonial church, but it’s one of the best places to eat fried fish within the walled city. With fried mojarra, a side of coconut rice, and an ice-cold Postobon Manzana, you won’t be disappointed. 

**Cost:** We spent 19,000 COP per person. Each meal included a whole fried fish, sides, and a soda.

**Tip:** Espíritu Santo can get pretty packed, so try to visit just after the restaurant opens.

##3. Walking on the Walls of the Walled City

**Location:** Ciudad Amurallada (multiple locations)

The walls of the walled city are accessible through ramps and stairs all along its perimeter. Here, you’ll encounter children eagerly flying kites, couples smooching on benches, and families searching for the best place to sit and enjoy their ice cream. The energy felt here is magical, just like the rest of Cartagena.

**Cost:** Free!

**Tip:** Walk on the walls as the sun sets and hunt for the best spot to admire the sea. 

##2. Palacio de la Inquisición

**Location:** Cra. 3 #33, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

This museum is as beautiful as it is educational. You’ll leave with a better understanding of what the Spanish Inquisition was and how it directly affected the Caribbean coast of Colombia. You’ll also learn some surprising things about the history of Cartagena (and how this history involved some infamous pirates). 

**Cost:** 19,000 COP per person (entry fee for adults)

**Tip:** Visitors enter for free on the last Sunday of every month!

##1. Castillo San Felipe de Barajas

**Location:** Cra. 17, Cartagena, Bolívar, Colombia

Expect to spend several hours meandering through the various towers, walls, and passageways of this immense structure. You’ll feel as though you’ve been transported back in time as you view the skyline of Cartagena from your perch on the castle that once protected the city from the invading British army. 

**Cost:** 25,000 COP per person (entry fee for non-Colombian citizens)

**Tip:** Be sure to visit the "hospital" for an informative video on the history of the Castillo San Felipe.
